### Definition

**Recursion** is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get into a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself.

A recursive function is a function that calls itself.

### The Three Laws of Recursion

* A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
* A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
* A recursive algorithm must call, recursively
