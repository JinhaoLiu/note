Reservoir sampling(水塘抽样) is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing `k` samples from a list of `n` items, where `n` is either a very large or unknown number. Typically `n` is large enough that the list doesn’t fit into main memory. For example, a list of search queries in Google and Facebook.

So we are given a big array (or stream) of numbers (to simplify), and we need to write an efficient function to randomly select k numbers where 1 <= k <= n. Let the input array be stream[].

A simple solution is to create an array `reservoir[]` of maximum size `k`. One by one randomly select an item from `stream[0..n-1]`. If the selected item is not previously selected, then put it in `reservoir[]`. To check if an item is previously selected or not, we need to search the item in `reservoir[]`. The time complexity of this algorithm will be $O(k^2)$. This can be costly if `k` is big. Also, this is not efficient if the input is in the form of a stream.


#### Problem

* Choose <code>k</code> entries from <code>n</code> numbers. Make sure each number is selected with the probability of <code>k/n</code>

** Basic idea**:

* Choose <code>1, 2, 3, ..., k</code> first and put them into the reservoir.
* For <code>k+1</code>, pick it with a probability of <code>k/(k+1)</code>, and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
* For <code>k+i</code>, pick it with a probability of <code>k/(k+i)</code>, and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
* Repeat until <code>k+i</code> reaches <code>n</code>

#### Proof

* For <code>k+i</code>, the probability that it is selected and will replace a number in the reservoir is <code>k/(k+i)</code>
* For a number in the reservoir before (let's say <code>X</code>), the probability that it keeps staying in the reservoir is
    * <code>P(X was in the reservoir last time)</code> × <code>P(X is not replaced by k+i)</code>

        = <code>P(X was in the reservoir last time)</code> × (<code>1</code> - <code>P(k+i is   selected and replaces X)</code>)
        = <code>k/(k+i-1)</code> × （<code>1</code> - <code>k/(k+i)</code> × <code>1/k</code>）
        = <code>k/(k+i)</code>

* When <code>k+i</code> reaches <code>n</code>, the probability of each number staying in the reservoir is <code>k/n</code>

#### Example

* Choose <code>3</code> numbers from <code>[111, 222, 333, 444]</code>. Make sure each number is selected with a probability of <code>3/4</code>
* First, choose <code>[111, 222, 333]</code> as the initial reservior
* Then choose <code>444</code> with a probability of <code>3/4</code>
* For <code>111</code>, it stays with a probability of

    <code>P(444 is not selected)</code> + <code>P(444 is selected but it replaces 222 or 333)</code>
    = <code>1/4</code> + <code>3/4</code>*<code>2/3</code>
    = <code>3/4</code>

* The same case with <code>222</code> and <code>333</code>.
* Now all the numbers have the probability of <code>3/4</code> to be picked.

具体的Java代码如下：

```Java
// A function to randomly select k items from stream[0..n-1]. 
static void selectKItems(int stream[], int n, int k) 
{ 
    int i;   // index for elements in stream[] 
      
    // reservoir[] is the output array. Initialize it with 
    // first k elements from stream[] 
    int reservoir[] = new int[k]; 
    for (i = 0; i < k; i++) 
        reservoir[i] = stream[i]; 
      
    Random r = new Random(); 
      
    // Iterate from the (k+1)th element to nth element 
    for (; i < n; i++) 
    { 
        // Pick a random index from 0 to i. 
        int j = r.nextInt(i + 1); 
          
        // If the randomly  picked index is smaller than k, 
        // then replace the element present at the index 
        // with new element from stream 
        if(j < k) 
            reservoir[j] = stream[i];             
    } 
      
}
```
