Given a binary tree

```Java
public class TreeLinkNode {
  int val;
  TreeLinkNode left, right, next;
  TreeLinkNode(int x) { val = x; }
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

Note:

* You may only use constant extra space.
* Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

Example:

Given the following binary tree,

```
     1
   /  \
  2    3
 / \    \
4   5    7
```

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

```
     1 -> NULL
   /  \
  2 -> 3 -> NULL
 / \    \
4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
```


#### Java

这道题目几乎和116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node一摸一样，只是去掉了条件--二叉树是完全二叉树。那么Q116中的解法1，解法2仍旧可以使用。问题是解法3可以使用吗？或者需要怎么样的更改？由于不是完全二叉树，需要增加一些判断，还需要保存每一层的开始位置，仅此而已。


```Java
public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
    TreeLinkNode next_head = null; //head of the next level
    TreeLinkNode next_prev = null; //the leading node on the next level
    TreeLinkNode cur = root;  //current node of current level

    while (cur != null) { // travel on diff levels
        while (cur != null) { //iterate on the current level
            //left child
            if (cur.left != null) {
                if (next_prev != null) next_prev.next = cur.left;
                else next_head = cur.left;
                next_prev = cur.left;
            }
            //right child
            if (cur.right != null) {
                if (next_prev != null) next_prev.next = cur.right;
                else next_head = cur.right;
                next_prev = cur.right;
            }
            //move to next node
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        
        // move to next level
        cur = next_head;
        next_head = null;
        next_prev = null;
    }
}
```
