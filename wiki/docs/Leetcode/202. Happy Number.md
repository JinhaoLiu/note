Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 


Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 

1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82
8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68
6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100
1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1


#### Java

直接采用题目所定义的Happy Number来写。采用HashSet判断重复。

```Java
public boolean isHappy(int n) {
    HashSet set = new HashSet();
    while (n != 1) {
        if (!set.add(n)) return false;
        int nt = n, digit;
        n = 0;
        while (nt != 0) {
            digit = nt % 10;
            n += digit*digit;
            nt /= 10;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
