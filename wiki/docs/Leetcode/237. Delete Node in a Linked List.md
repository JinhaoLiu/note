Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

```
4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
```

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```


Note:

* The linked list will have at least two elements.
* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
* Do not return anything from your function.


#### Java

在单向链表中删除一个节点，最常规的做法是从链表的头结点开始，顺序遍历查找要删除的节点，并在链表中删除该节点。例如下图(a)中删除节点$i$，找到$i$的前一个节点$h$，让$h$指向$j$。时间复杂度是$O(n)$.

之所以需要从头开始查找，是因为我们需要得到将被删除的结点的前⾯⼀个结点。但这是必须的吗？答案是否定的。如果把下一个节点的内容复制到需要删除的节点上，再删除下一个节点，其效果等于删除当前节点。



```Java
/**
 * we have to replace the value of the node we want to
 * delete with the value in the node after it,
 * and then delete the node after it.
 */
public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
}
```
