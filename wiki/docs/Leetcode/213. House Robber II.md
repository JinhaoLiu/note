You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

Example 1:

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```


#### Java


这道题目是LeetCode 198. House Robber的延伸，既然已经知道了House Robber怎么写的，那么就可以把这道题目分解了。由于房子是圆形排列的，因此，不能同时抢首尾的房子，也就是说有两种抢法：0~last-1和1~last。


```Java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null) return 0;
    int n = nums.length;
    if (n == 1) return nums[0];
    return Math.max(rob(nums, 1, n), rob(nums, 0, n - 1));
}
    
private int rob(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
    int last = 0, secondLast = 0, cur = 0;
    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
        cur = Math.max(nums[i] + secondLast, last);
        secondLast = last;
        last = cur;
    }
    return cur;   
}
```
