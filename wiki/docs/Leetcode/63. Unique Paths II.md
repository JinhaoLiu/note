A robot is located at the top-left corner of a $m \times n$ grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?


![Robot Maze](http://or9a8nskt.bkt.clouddn.com/LeetCode62.png?imageslim)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

Note: $m$ and $n$ will be at most 100.

Example 1:

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```


#### 分析

在LeetCode 62. Unique Paths的基础上加了一个限制条件，路径上可能有石头。其实代码也只需要变动一次：判断有没有石头。

```Java
public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
    if (obstacleGrid == null || obstacleGrid.length == 0 || obstacleGrid[0].length == 0) 
        return 0;
    if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1) return 0;
    int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
    int[][] numPaths = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
    numPaths[1][1] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < m + 1; i++)
        for (int j = 1; j < n + 1; j++) {
            if (i == 1 && j == 1) continue;
            if (obstacleGrid[i - 1][j - 1] == 1) numPaths[i][j] = 0;
            else numPaths[i][j] = numPaths[i][j - 1] + numPaths[i - 1][j];
        }
    return numPaths[m][n];
}
```
