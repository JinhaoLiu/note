You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

#### Java

这道题目和[Maximum weight independent set of path graph](https://techlarry.github.io/note-algorithm/algorithmStanford/dynamicprogramming/#2-application-maximum-weight-independent-set-of-path-graph)一摸一样！真是佩服出题人，能改编成这样。

题目中的不能抢相邻的房间，相当于构建一个独立集。要求抢的物品价值最高，相当于构建一个最大独立集。

```Java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    int[] totals = new int[nums.length + 2];
    for (int i = 2; i < totals.length; i++)
        totals[i] = Math.max(nums[i - 2] + totals[i - 2], totals[i - 1]);
    
    return totals[totals.length - 1];   
}
```

可以舍去中间结果：

```Java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    int last = 0, secondLast = 0, cur = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        cur = Math.max(nums[i] + secondLast, last);
        secondLast = last;
        last = cur;
    } 
    return cur;   
}
```
