Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.


For example, the following two linked lists:

```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```

begin to intersect at node c1.


Notes:


* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

 *   If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
 *   The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
 *   You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
 *
 *
 * Solution: Two Pointers
 *   使用两个指针，每个指针指向一个链表头部。
 *   然后使用指针遍历链表，达到链表尾部后，遍历另一个链表，直到链表尾部。
 *
 *   如果存在交叉，那么这两个指针在第二次遍历以后肯定会相遇。即pointA = pointB，
 *   如果直到遍历结束，还没有相遇，即没有交叉。题目不要求一定相交。
 *
 * Complexity Analysis
 *   Time complexity : O(m+n)O(m+n).
 *   Space complexity : O(1)O(1).
