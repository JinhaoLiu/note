####  入门

[WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org) is a free network protocol analyzer.

A packet sniffer(分组嗅探器) captures (“sniffs”) messages being sent/received from/by your computer; it will also typically store and/or display the contents of the various protocol fields in these captured messages.

The packet sniffer consists of two parts:

* **packet capture library** receives a copy of every link-layer frame that is sent from 1 or received by your computer.
* **packet analyzer** displays the contents of all fields within a protocol message.
