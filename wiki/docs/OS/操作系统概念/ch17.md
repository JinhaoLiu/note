#### Goals of Protection

Protection was originally conceived as an adjunct to multiprogramming operating system,

* to allow untrustworthy users to safely share a common logical name space, such as a directory files, or a common physical name space, such as memory.

Modern protection,

* to increase the reliability of any complex system that makes use of shared resources and is connected to insecure communications platforms such as Internet.

Protection are needed for several reasons.

* Preventing the mischievous, intentional violation of an access restriction by a user is needed.
* Protection can improve reliability by detecting latent errors at the interfaces between component subsystems.
* provide a mechanism for the enforcement of the policies governing resource use
